## Welcome to my website
My field of interest lies in optical science and technology. Particularly, I want to focus on optical device development both in the micro-level and classical instrument level. I am also very interested in optics combined with computer science, electronic engineering and mechanical engineering because modern optical systems require a combination of them all.
