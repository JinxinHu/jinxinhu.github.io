### Research
My field of interest lies in optical science and technology. Particularly, I want to focus on optical device development both in the micro-level and classical instrument level. I am also very interested in optics combined with computer science(eg. Computer Vision), electronic engineering. Because modern optical systems require a combination of them all.
